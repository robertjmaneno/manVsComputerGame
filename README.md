 Rock paper scissors game

 “Rock paper scissors” is a simple and interesting game. Many of us used to play it in a school to resolve disputes or just to spend some time.How ever in this game a player who is a human will play against a computer.  I'm developing this game with the aim of improving my javacript skills.
